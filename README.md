# Maths-Game
Welcome to the source code for my maths game. A simple program where the user
is asked 10 questions, and has his results read back to him at the end.

The work is licensed under the creative commons Attribution 4.0 International, 
essentially meaning that you are free to use this work however you like, including 
commercially. So you could take this and use it as a framework for something bigger, 
feel free to. I only request that you think about giving some code back to the origional 
program so it can grow too.
